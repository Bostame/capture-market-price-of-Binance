simple node js code to capture market price of different symbols from Binance and update it after each 10 sec
price_update_1.js ==> gives updated price of symbols after each 10 second. I have used binance api to call the price and name
price_update_2.js ==> gives updated price of symbols(historical data) after each 10 second. I have tried to used cctx package to call binance api and the price and name
